# Techdegree-PHP-Unit-4
 Techdegree Unit4 Project
 This project is about phrase hunting.
 When the game is started, player is presented with a random empty blocks that represent a particular phrase.
 The player is expected to guess each letter of the phrase by selecting from the online keyboard or using computer keyboard.
 Player has only 5 lives, which means 5 misses would end the game.
 Player wins if he/she is able to guess all the letters of the phrase correctly before using all his/her 5 lives.
